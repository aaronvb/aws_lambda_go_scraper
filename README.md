# Scrape websites with AWS Labmda
This is a basic website scraper written in Go that will search for text.

If text is found, results are e-mailed to user through Amazon SES.

## Why
I built this to let me know when certain websites update with the text I'm looking for. This utilizes AWS Lambda and cron to run continuously without a server setup.

## How to use this
